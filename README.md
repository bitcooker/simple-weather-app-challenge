# Challenge - Simple Weather App

## requirement
Have some statistic built for data from an API and a ready to use component (e.g. button that respects different statuses)
With React take any public web api and let them calculate values you are interested in with React.
Button component is more to see if they think of all cases. e.g. button disable should happen when loading is active etc.
